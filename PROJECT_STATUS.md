# Black Hole Physics Engine - Project Status

## Current Status

The Black Hole Physics Engine is currently in development with several components in various states of completion.

### What's Working

1. **Core Mathematical Utilities**
   - Vector operations (add, subtract, scale, dot product, cross product)
   - Basic coordinate transformations
   - Mathematical constants and conversions

2. **Basic Black Hole Parameters**
   - Schwarzschild black hole parameters
   - Time dilation calculations
   - Simple orbital mechanics

3. **Simplified Demonstrations**
   - Time dilation visualization
   - Orbital velocity calculations
   - Gravitational lensing approximations
   - Accretion disk visualization

### What Needs Fixing

1. **API Consistency Issues**
   - Function signatures in headers don't match implementations
   - Conflicting type definitions in some header files
   - Inconsistent parameter types across function calls

2. **Numerical Integration Issues**
   - ODE solver function signatures need updating
   - RK4 and RKF45 integrators need parameter corrections
   - Geodesic equation implementation needs revision

3. **Coordinate Transformation Issues**
   - Mismatch between value-based and pointer-based APIs
   - Incorrect function calls to cartesian_to_spherical and spherical_to_cartesian

4. **Build System Issues**
   - Variable-sized array initialization in main.c
   - Missing functions in the public API

## How to Test Current Functionality

Despite these issues, you can test the core functionality with:

1. **Simplified Test**: `.\simple_build.bat`
   - Demonstrates the key physics concepts with no dependencies on the complex code
   - Shows time dilation, orbital mechanics, gravitational lensing, and accretion disk

2. **Core Math Test**: `.\test_build.bat`
   - Tests the vector operations and coordinate transformations
   - Verifies the mathematical foundation of the engine

## Next Steps

1. **Fix API Consistency**
   - Update function declarations to match implementations
   - Standardize parameter types (especially BlackHoleParams pointers)

2. **Fix Coordinate Transformations**
   - Update all calls to use the pointer-based API
   - Ensure correct parameter order and types

3. **Fix ODE Integrators**
   - Update rkf45_integrate function to match its declaration
   - Fix parameter passing in all integrator calls

4. **Update Main Program**
   - Fix variable-sized array initialization
   - Implement missing API functions (bh_calculate_orbital_velocity)

## Roadmap

| Component | Status | Priority | Estimated Effort |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------------|
| Math Utils | Partially Working | High | Low |
| Time Dilation | Working | Low | None |
| Orbital Mechanics | Partially Working | Medium | Medium |
| Ray Tracing | Not Working | High | High |
| Particle Simulation | Not Working | Medium | High |
| API | Partially Working | High | Medium |

## Testing Now

While the full engine is being fixed, you can still test the core concepts with the simplified implementation:

```
.\simple_build.bat
```

This will demonstrate accurate results for time dilation, orbital mechanics, gravitational lensing, and provide a visualization of the accretion disk without requiring the full engine to be fixed.
